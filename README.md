# Day 3 – Arrow Functions

## What I Learned

- Arrow function syntax
- filter() + map() with objects
- Chaining operations

# Day 4 – Node.js Basics

- Run JavaScript in Node.js terminal
- Variables and conditionals
- Functions with parameters
- Objects and accessing properties

# Day 5 – Arrays of Objects

- Created arrays of objects
- Used forEach to loop through objects
- Used filter to select specific objects
- Used map to extract properties
- Created reusable functions with arrays

# Day 6 — For Loops

Learned how to use for loops to manually process arrays.

Concepts practiced:
- Basic for loop structure
- Looping through arrays using index
- Using if statements inside loops
- Counting values that match a condition
- Calculating sum of numbers
- Finding largest number in array
- Building new arrays using push()

# Day 7 — Object Processing

Learned how to process arrays of objects using for loops and conditionals.

Concepts practiced:
- Looping through arrays of objects
- Finding a specific user by property
- Finding the oldest user using comparison pattern
- Building new arrays with push()
- Filtering objects based on conditions
- Extracting specific properties from objects


 Day 8 — Functions with Arrays of Objects

Learned how to structure reusable functions for backend logic with arrays of objects.

Concepts practiced:
- Writing functions that process arrays
- Returning values from functions
- Looping inside functions
- Returning single objects vs arrays
- Returning specific properties
- Combining filtering, searching, and comparison patterns inside functions
